# Download and Install

If you want to use Cobweb, click [here for the Mac version](https://github.com/cobweb-gang/cobweb/releases.download/v0.1.0/Cobweb-0.1.0-osx.dmg) and [here for Linux](https://github.com/cobweb-gang/cobweb/releases.download/v0.1.0/cobweb-0.1.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz).

## Use

Once you install and start up Cobweb, you will be greeted with a window. You'll first want to visit the [list](https://cobweb-gang.github.io/list) and grab the IP and password of a server. Once you've done that, copy and paste them into their respective text boxes, and then click the connect button. After a few seconds, you should be all set!
