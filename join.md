# Join the Gang

If you want to make your private Cobweb server public and officially join the federation, send an email to [dbernado@protonmail.com](mailto:dbernado@protonmail.com) containing the following:

- Your server's IP address and password
- Your server's system specs (specifically processor, RAM, drive space, and internet speed)
- Your server's location

Additionally, it should contain a restatement of the following agreement:

```
I promise not to keep logs of clients who connect through my server.
```

Finally, sign the email with your full name. We will test your server, and if we deem it stable we will add it to the list.
