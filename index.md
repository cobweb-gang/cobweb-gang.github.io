## Cobweb

Cobweb is a VPN software suite based on a fast and simple custom VPN protocol, designed for building a decentralized federation of self-hosted servers. We aim to create a free, easy to use and trustable VPN service for ourselves and anyone else to use amidst growing privacy and security concerns.

Currently Linux and MacOS clients are supported, while Windows support is a long-term goal but not currently planned. Only Linux is supported on the server side.
